# Cybersec-Scripts

# 🛠️ CyberSec Scripts Collection

The goal of this repository is to showcase a collection of scripts related to cybersecurity, ethical hacking, electronics, robotics, and computer science. 
All materials are intended for educational purposes and are part of my personal learning journey in cybersecurity and overall development in computer science.

## 📁 Structure

Scripts are grouped in folders according to their domain or purpose. For example:

- `check_password/` — A script to check if a password that has been created has been cracked or leaked anywhere.
- `password_dictionary_generator/` - A script for generating dictionaries for various purposes, such as brute-force attacks.
- `bluetooth_device_scanner/` — A script for scanning Bluetooth devices and checking their MAC addresses.
- `bruteforce_md5_cracker/` — A script for performing a brute force attack on MD5 hashes.
Expect more tools and scripts to be added shortly
