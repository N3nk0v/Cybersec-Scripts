üîê Password Security Checker
This script helps users evaluate the security of their passwords by performing both local and online checks, along with password strength analysis.

Features:
Local Check: The script checks if the password is present in a predefined password dictionary file (such as rockyou.txt).
Online Check: It also queries the HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) service using the k-anonymity model to verify if the password has been exposed in any public data breaches.

Password Strength Analysis: It evaluates password strength based on the following criteria:
Minimum length: 12 characters for medium strength, longer than 16 for strong. Contains uppercase and lowercase letters.
Includes at least one digit and one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).
Strong passwords must meet all these conditions and exceed 16 characters.
                                                       
User Interaction:
The user is prompted to input a password, after which the script provides feedback on:
Password strength (Strong, Medium, Weak).
                                                       
Exposure check:
If it exists in a dictionary file locally.
If it has been exposed in public breaches via HIBP.

How to Use:
Choose Option: Select whether to check the password locally (using a dictionary) or online (via HIBP).
Input Password: Enter the password to evaluate.
View Results: Receive feedback on password strength and exposure status.
Repeat: Option to check more passwords.

This tool is intended to help improve password security by identifying weak or compromised passwords.
